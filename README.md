# Udacity_DS_NanoDegree
This is a repository for the projects I had to work on whilst completing a Nano Degree course from Udacity

Project 1:
AirBnB Seattle Dataset

The underlying datasources comprised of the prices of airbnbs since listing, the listing details - geo, owner and ratings details and finally a review file with the comments received for each listing

What is this problem that I tried to solve here?

I have done sentiment analysis on the review data and assigned a sentiment score to each listing
I have then tried adding an additional parameter to see if the price of an Airbnb has gone up, gone down or remained the same. I then combined this with other features of a listing
say number of bedrooms, bathrooms, reviews received etc and try to classify into different sentiments (Positive, negative or Neutral)
