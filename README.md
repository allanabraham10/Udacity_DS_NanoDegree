# Udacity_DS_NanoDegree
This is a repository for the projects I had to work on whilst completing a Nano Degree course from Udacity

Project 1:
AirBnB Seattle Dataset

Medium Blog - https://medium.com/@pa.allan10/seattle-airbnb-dataset-insights-cef8acc069e2


The underlying datasources comprised of the prices of airbnbs since listing, the listing details - geo, owner and ratings details and finally a review file with the comments received for each listing

What is this problem that I tried to solve here?

I have done sentiment analysis on the review data and assigned a sentiment score to each listing
I have then tried adding an additional parameter to see if the price of an Airbnb has gone up, gone down or remained the same. I then combined this with other features of a listing
say number of bedrooms, bathrooms, reviews received etc and try to classify into different sentiments (Positive, negative or Neutral)

Other business insights that we could generate were
- Majority of the bookings were made for single bedrooms, around 64%
- Furthermore around 58% of the users opted for a single bed
- Airbnb should target these sort of customers to get value for their money
- Single room single bed opting customers tended to give more feedback on their stay on an average
- We could see there is an increase in review scores rating as the number of beds and bedrooms increase
- No general trends were observed based on the number of ammenities provided
