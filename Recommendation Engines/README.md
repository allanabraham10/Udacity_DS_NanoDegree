# IBM Recommendation Engine

## Overview
This project was designed to analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles that they might be interested in.

## Packages
List of packages used:

- Pandas
- Pickle

## Summary:
The project contains the following tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis: This part is for data exploration.
Rank Based Recommendations: recommended the most popular articles based on the highest user interactions
User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: recommended unseen articles that were viewed by most similar users
Content Based Recommendations: recommended articles based on similarity of content
Matrix Factorization: performed SVD to predict articles a user might interact with

## File Descriptions
You can find the results of the analysis in either html form and Jupyter Notebook:
